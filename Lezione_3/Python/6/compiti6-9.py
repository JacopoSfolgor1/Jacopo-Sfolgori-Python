'''6-9. Favorite Places: Make a dictionary called favorite_places. Think of three names to use as keys in the dictionary, 
and store one to three favorite places for each person. To make this exercise a bit more interesting, 
ask some friends to name a few of their favorite places. 
Loop through the dictionary, and print each personâ€™s name and their favorite places.'''

favorite_places: dict = {"Jacopo" : "Japan, Norway, Switzerland", "Federico" : "Iran, Afghanistan", "Riccardo" : "Russia"}

for key, value in favorite_places.items():
    print(f"{key} loves {value}")
